* Axe - Fast, mid-high dmg, mid-low health
* Archer - Fast, mid dmg, range, low health
* Executioner - Slow, Tank, Heavy dmg
* Arbalist - Slow, High dmg, range, mid-low health

* Magic vs Nonmagic vs Mixed
  * Magic - advanced mythical flying units, special spells, low resource gen, optimistic
  * Mixed magic - a  bit of both
  * Nonmagic - led by pessimistic puritans, advanced armor and units, eats more meat


Make in the style of Overcooked, fat little squishy heroes, limited space

## Building Supplies

### Wood
* Chop, 3 logs (depending on tree size)
* Bring to saw mill to turn to wood planks (2 for each log)
* Used in buildings, crafting

### Stone
* Infinite
* Gather from mines (time consuming) as cobblestone (for crafting)
* Carve into stone bricks for building

## Natural Resources

### Coal
* Used for heating advanced elements - iron, cooking meat, bread, etc.
* More efficient than burning wood

### Iron Ore
* By Product of turning cobblestone into stone bricks
* Found in mines
* Must be smelted in furnaces to iron bars



## Food

### Grass
* Inefficient, usually just gathered to clear land
* Quick food source

### Apples
* Found in trees
* Can be gathered by cutting down tree or gathering from trees
* Supplemntal food source, but not space efficient/fast enough growth

### Wheat|Bread
* Same effectiveness as grass
* Can be processed into flour (which is processed to bread)
* THe "bread and butter" of food, if you will (after turning to bread)

### Dead Bodies
* Full meal for carnivores
* Not as efficient as butchering
* Can be brought to butcher to prepare

### Butchered Meat
* Seperates corpse into several pieces to be eaten individually
* More efficient

### Cooked Meat
* Requires being roasted over fire
* More effective than butchered meat

## Buildings

* Putting two buildings of the same type next to each other combine them
* Bonuses as more buildings are next to each other

### Houses
* Needed to increase population
* Main limiter in units along with food, due to space constraints
* 4 in a square or row: 5 people can live there 

### Sawmill
* Transforms wood to planks
* 3 in a Row: Advanced saw mill, much faster plank creation and needs only one worker
* Stores some wood

### Stone Mason
* Converts cobblestone to stone bricks
* Stores some stone
* 2 in a Row: Uses crane for faster stone docking and undocking

### Tool Maker
* Makes basic tools (pickaxe, axe, hoe, etc.)
* Small (1 unit)
* 4 in a square allow smithing (iron tool)

### Weapon maker
* 4 unit square
* Makes metal weapons (sword, axe, shield, etc.)
* 4 in a square: less speed, expensive and takes up a lot of space, but can make advanced gear (plate armor) and weapons are all 150% more effective

### Storage
* Cheap, cobblestone
* Stores Materials
* Can be assigned only one material
* Though space-inefficient, the buffer allows potentially more productivity, modularity, and scalability

### Sleds|Wooden Storage
* Cheap, wood
* Like storage units, though half storage
* Can be moved with items on it

### Granary
* Alt Storage unit
* Can only hold food
* Holds double the food over a regular storage

### Racks
* Alt Storage Unit
* Can only hold tools/weapons/armor
* *Holds double the armaments over regular storage

### Fence
* Cheapest Wall Type
* One plank cover 2 units
* Quick barricade to slow down enemy for one second, though can be easily destroyed

### Wooden Wall
* Medium Wall Type

### Stone Wall
* Can be walked on
* Requires building up over several materials
* Expensive

### Keep
* Your house, starting building
* Can house a few units itself
* Flag is at top
* Upgrades to it boost all units (can only choose a few upgrades) or unlocks certain buildings, acts as a buildable "tech tree" in a sense
