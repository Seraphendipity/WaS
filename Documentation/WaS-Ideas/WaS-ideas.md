When the sheep "marry", they kiss, and then after a delay of 1s, one of them becomes pregnant --  a giant ball that cant move itself and just rolls around.

Also
Wolf are players, purebloods with sharp teeth, tails, ears, etc. and the physically larger units.
Weeps/Weepers/Sholves/Wolf-Sheep/half bloods/demis: when pureblood wolf marries sheep or two halfbloods marry, the soldier caste; feeds on sheep
Sheep: the worker class and brunt of the force 

Food for the Sheeple takes HUGGGE amounts of land, much more than your buildings,
As such, it is dificult to cover it and thus players are couraged to build a strong
keep to retreat to. This thusly encourages building a food stock so you can
prepare units in your castle, charge out and crush the invaders, while also limiting
defensive turtling as eventually you'll starve out

Like that monster farmville from way back, music generated from sounds of the game, your people humming or singing a tune; atmosphereic

While thematically the sholves make a great tool, I am worried about the issue of Castle Story. It used to have military and econonmy units seperate, but whent hey changed it to them being interchangeable, it made a whole lot more sense (as military were just diffferent tools) and fun (as during non-wartime your military units were not just standing stupid). Some alternatives
* No Sholves: inline with te initial idea, only sheep and wolf. Sheep fulfill military roles as well
* Military Tasks: Sholves can be assigned military tasks to manage walls, patrol and clear paths, make weapons, etc. further seperating the economy and military sector. THe con being just that, though, with two seemingly seperate ideas being supported only by the sholf eat sheeple relationship
* Emphasize Military Tasks: Scouting, patrolling, etc. could be emphasized by theivery, by domestic issues that require police/military surveillance, etc. make it a constant task.
* Sholves are more Powerful Sheep: They have greater effectiveness, can do work faster, carry more, better soldiers with better AI that flanks and such. However, they feed on Sheeple, and the efficiency is not linear: using the sheep used to sustain a sholf directly outdoes the work of an individual sholf, thus with infinite space and no pressure you are better off with no sholves to maximize food and such. However, the sholves are in essence the "stronger, tech race" that come in handy when it's more practical to have a couple strong units over tons of weaker units.
* Sholves are more Specialized Sheep: Not exclusive, the sholves are better at military tasks and such while sheeple are better at other tasks. I dont like this one too much 

Later ideas such as magic and gems and souls may be implemented

Individual traits?

Sheep forget easily, but also must be impressed constantly, while sholves have a longer span of forgiveness and enjoyability, thus will not abandon on simple grounds but also will not endure longterm neglect

Tiered Buildings in 2 directions: x (quantity) and y (quality). Take a home for instance. At the most basic level a rundown little shack for 1. You can increase its size for more occupants while maintaining quality (that is, poor and small) or its quality (a very gorgeous and spacious room for one), with, of course, room in between for varying levels of quantity and quality.

* **Wolves and Sheep**

Possibly, turn into 2D or 2.5D...
* Allows combat to be a more typical 2D fighter without having to take considerations of 3D movement
* Simplified individual controls allowing you to focus on groups.
* Can double down on the "pathfinding" and "throughput" parts of the game, as 2D fundamentally limits your space, especially if characters cannot pass one another.
* Can serve as a "1.0" before a 3D version is attempted in the future, as proof of concept, prototype, and standalone game.
* Can allow more "terraria" or "minecrafty" elements, building your own bunkers instead of pre-built buildings (which are necessary for at least a alpha WaS 3D).
* Interesting concept with a "circle" world that laps around, each of you on opposite sides. Possibly even a "Mobius Strip world" if 2.5D. Thus things are not square or cube, but rather slightly trapezoidal
  * Note there are two ways that it can be a circle: you could have it wrap around in a circle of the xy axis, that is, the enemy is directly beneath you if you dig down enough (you are standing on the outside of the circle's border, as a "typical earth"), OR have a Halo-esque circle, where you are standing on top of the circle's border, that is the enemy is behind you in the Z axis and you can see them at a far off distance in the background (and if a mobius strip, they're "upside down").
* Ant Farmy feel is nice.
* "Full View" Mode (normal) and "Realistic" mode (can only see what room you are in, thus cant see what your workers are doing in your base, allowing sneak attacks)
* Can still be 2.5D, with 2 or 3 "z layers", allowing walking by, and crawling on backedges if you do not make walls

# Insect Wars
A 2D game taking place inside an ant farm. You start out as an ant queen in a single chamber, and on the other side of the colony is the other queen, your sister. There can be only one queen, though...

## Gameplay
Gather food from smaller creatures to feed your queen and lay more eggs. Make more rooms to house more food and eggs. There is a balance here, for while egg costs are low, the more creatures you have the more food is consumed each day. If there aren't enough creatures to maintain and defend the eggs, you are also screwed. Additionally, occasionally disasters will strike, such as timely flooding or smoke out, in which case you will need to stay underground for a bit, necessitating food stores (which can be done by food accumulation or Honeypot ants).

## Unita
You have a variety of ant types avaliable to produce: 
* Basic worker ants: your bread and butter, gather food, tend to eggs and larvae, keep everyone fed, and dig holes. They can also attack. They can do just about everything well, but master nothing. The other ants can also do almost everything, but suck at it except for what they were deisgned for.
* Honeypot Ants: your more efficient form of food storage, keep your food stored in their bellies. After nesting to store food, cannot do much, but can still bite to hold their own if attacked.
* Kamikaze Ants: when killed, shoot a paralyzing acid to stun nearby small insects, but are weaker than other ants. The acid affects his kin as well.
* Army Ants: the biggest and baddest fighters, require significantly more food to maintain and cannot dig or feed as well, but are your tanks and main military unit
* Brood Carers: Specialized to take care of larvae, increase the quality of ants under their care as well as the rate at which they grow, thus proving invaluable, but suck at digging and fighting.
* Princesses: capable of flying, these are powerful units that can also start nests and lay more eggs (when they grow to a queen they are still under your care), but need huge amounts of food to maintain and especially grow.
* Drones: the males, they are similar to army ants though slower and more powerful, they exlcusively stay close to the queen to protect her; note that since they stay in or near her chamber, you must be careful not to overcrowd her or else grabbing eggs will be hindered.
* Anaerobic Ants: Can be drowned in water and still function, albeit at reduced rate, and are slowerer overall even out of water, great for managing floods as they can absorb a good bit of water and spit it out or swim across channels.
* Traitor Ants: Uses the chemicals of the enemy queen, allowing them to sneak into her ranks, but is still under full control of you. This means that if they notice that it isn't as respondant as her other ants, she can kill it (or if she sees it marching her way). Additionally, once it matures, it will instantly be seen as a pest that must be killed except by brood carers, thus must be raised without protection elsewhere or in a batch that can escape somewhat unscathed.

Other species can be tamed: bees, for instance, which can carry ants around, form honey as a food source, and do kamikaze kills before returning to die (and be eaten). Dragonflies can be tamed as powerful transport units. Spiders too can create invisble web traps for enemies. Aphids are the primary friend you'll make, as they can be farmed for dew droplets by feeding them leaves, which can be grown, thus giving you a stable food supply. 

However, aside from your enemy, there are also other enemies to beware:
* Spiders, from small ones ot large monsters, will prove a constant nemesis.
* Bees will usually leave you alone, until you start taking down their flowers if you need room for farms.

## Combat
* When two ants face each other, they interlock, and cannot kill one another. If another ant can get above or behind one, though, it can deliver a killing blow.
* Army Ants, Princesses, and Drones are naturaly bigger and can thus reach over an individual ant and kill it
* Bodies do not disappear on death, but collapse and must be crawled over, eaten, or taken elsewhere.
* Large battles typically come down to throwing as many ants as you can, watching them pile up against one another until one side overlaps the other and starts killing them from the top and behind. Again, army ants benefit here as they can interlock multiple smaller ants at a time and stack much higher, allowing a quick gain in height.
* Bees/Dragonflies can be used to do kamikaze runs or drop ants behind to attack.
* In interlocked battles, tunnels can be made under the enemy to get behind them.
* Battles of about even numbers likely take a long time, with constant deployment of units to maintain tension, until one side surges through with a ton of units, gets enough units behind them to make a difference in tunneling, flying over, or crawling over, or other such development. Yes, it's almost parodying most RTS's which, at least at lower levels, is just "throw everything at them".


## Misc.
* Large spout on other side behind enemy base. Will slowly flood enemy's base, though requires a lot of units to turn. Alternatively, an exit only for your team. Or maybe some other alt objective, or a special unit that can reveals the queens and can help dig to her
* Maybe queens sense each other, thus know their general presence, as they get closer they get more detailed match of where they are
* Large vertical water in between you and your enemy, requiring building over it, flying over it, filling it in, or sacrificing enough ants to form a bridge.
* Ants cannot overlap (theyre surrounded by glass walls), thus throughput issues with regards to small tunnels
* This can also lead, if successful, to a Xenomorph game where you fight over a colony of humans.
