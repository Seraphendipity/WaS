## Simplified Fighting System
* Stamina/Posture System
* "Weighty Units" -- Units take up noticeable space, body blocking

### Core Components
* Melee - Fast mixup moves, does not kill but good at wearing down stamina, safe offense
  * Jab: Fast, Interuptor, Close Range, Uncharged 
  * Punch: Main Melee, Counters Jab on Startup, Good Stamina Damage
  * Uppercut: Slow and Unreliable, Counterable by Punch, Used to Mixup Punch Timing occasionally
* Weapon Attack - Generally Kill Moves or heavily damaging, but reactable and counterable
  * Stab (uncharged weapon attack): Stab, Very Block Stam-Drain
  * Slash (charged weapon attack): Stab, great against blocking opponents
  * Soft-Feint to Pommel (acts like punch): weak against block, great stam dmg on opened opponent (punishes parry attempts)
* Standard Blocking
  * In attack stance, you auto-block attacks as long as youre facing in that direction
  * Turns fatal sword strikes into stamina strikes against you
  * Not many "downsides" aside from less
* Ready Stance
  * Hold Sword Up to Block Attacks
  * Plants yourself, can only turn in limited radius
  * Cannot be budged by most attacks
  * Drops guard, and as such takes extra damage from punches and hits
  * Releasing Parries (200ms startup to parry, 100ms release, requires read), high risk
  * Can be accessed mid-combo for defense in chain
  * Can access slow hyperarmored unblockable (shine to blade), only beatable by parry. Note that hyperarmor only matters if the attack doesnt kill you, and parries are accessible in chain, ie they can hit and parry attempt easily, so you have to be ready to feint and mixup
* Commander-Fools Stance
  * "Dearms", as if out of combat stances entirely, albeit can be held to allow quick command options whilst being ready to jump back into combat instantly (ie midcombat commands)
  * Restores stamina the fastest
  * Same button is used to feint, and return to neutral

### General Punishes/Damage
* Stabs/Slashes against No-guard (ie against commander stance, right after a missed parry, etc.) instakills
* Blocking stab gives no frame advantage to either
* Blocking slash gives frame advantage to attacker.
  * Defender can launch jab to catch a followup slash attempt, but NOT stab attempt, ie instadeath if they stab)
* Parrying grants a free punch followup for good stamina punishment, *and* insta refills some stamina from posture, *and* that jab allows them to get into combo.
* Whiffed parries allow a punch from the opponent

### Stamina
* Short-Term Energy
* Loosely, "Health" of character -- loosing it often allows enemies to kill you.
* The posture and stance of the character tells you their stamina (trembling, hunched over, tongue out, etc. indicate low stamina)
* Magic also comes from stamina.
* Regenerates rather fast from posture.

### Posture
* Measures long-term wellbeing.
* Each component is refilled by different parameters.
* Pools for each are not equal -- water empties quickly and is quick to refill, sleep takes time to refill and empty
* Used to refill stamina
* Necessary for multiple fights.
* Pulls from all elements equally when replenishing stamina.
* If an element is empty before the others, the unit can "persevere" on the other components, but at 4 times the cost 
  * Say they lack sleep and just exerted themselves, needing to replenish stamina. It will drain the food and water as normal, then for whatever amount of sleep is needed, the water and food are converted over, albeit at a 4 times cost. 
  * This conversion rate increases over time as that element remains empty. It also is not instantly reset upon some replenish, only over time is the conversion rate slowly lowered. This allows over exertion, but you'll have to make up for it later in a sense.
* The greater the posture, the greater the stamina refill rate, based on the least-filled element (another benefit of maintaining all elements).

#### Water - Hydration
#### Food - Hunger
#### Sleep - Awareness

#### Relax - Entertainment (TBD)
* Perhaps a consideration for future.
* Can allow psyche elements and tactics; loyalty

### Submit or Kill? (TBD)
At least two ways to defeat an opponent: kill them or make them surrender. Killing them allows them to be consumed and is generally an easier option. Additionally you can knok them out, taking them prisoner or killing them. Lastly you can turn them (from knockout to imprisonment or demoralization)

### Inverted Darksouls: Reactable Defense
Against AI, the player can almost always dominate. The AI uses various defenses, but the more active ones (at least for lesser troops) are reactable -- that is, you can counter them by watching their movements.

Trained units have unreactable defenses they can mixup, like the player, and as such require predictions. Higher "skilled" units, after a certain level, can also react to the defenses of weaker units. A 5-star CQC can ALWAYS beat a 1-star without taking a hit in a 1v1. This is done by increasing reaction speed variable over their levels(?)
